                <h2>tARget</h2>
                <p>In one of my classes during the spring of 2025, I was 
                    tasked with making an <strong>AR experience.</strong> I 
                    decided to create a simple game using <strong>Unreal Engine.</strong> 
                    From Unreal, I <strong>packaged my project for Android,</strong> 
                    and people in the class could play it on a Galaxy tablet.<br>
                    In the game, users have 30 seconds to hit as many targets as they can. 
                    Targets appear randomly within a range of motion around their device's 
                    initial position. Users can tilt and move their device to aim, and they 
                    can tap the screen to fire a ball at a target. <br>
                    This was my first time working with a game engine, and I learned a 
                    lot about Unreal from this project. In particular, I learned how 
                    to use Unreal's node-based approach to programming.
