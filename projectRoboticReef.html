                <h2>Robotic Reef</h2>
                <p>As a follow-up to the robotic light drawing group project, 
                    I was tasked with making a second light drawing individually. 
                    For this second project, I used the same approach of mounting 
                    a microcontroller on the university's 
                    <strong>KUKA robotic arm</strong> and taking a long exposure 
                    photograph of its path of motion. This time, however, I wanted 
                    to create an actual picture instead of just an abstract pattern.<br>
                    I settled on a design of a sea turtle swimming through a coral 
                    reef. I chose this design because I felt that it would lend 
                    itself well to the generative algorithms we had been learning 
                    about in class. To make the final image seen here, I actually made 
                    4 different light drawings, and I used Photoshop to combine them 
                    together. Each light drawing was made using the 
                    <strong>Grasshopper parametric design software,</strong> and 3 of 
                    the scripts integrated Python code as well.<br>
                    The most complicated light drawings were the two pieces of coral. 
                    To create these, I had to implement a 
                    <strong>stack data structure</strong> to create a backtracking logic. 
                    This was necessary because the robot's movement commands travel from 
                    point to point sequentially. However, coral has a branching structure, 
                    so the robot was drawing lines directly from the end of one branch to 
                    the base of another. Integrating <strong>Python code</strong> within 
                    my Grasshopper scripts helped me to solve issues like this.
